## Notes

**Spec Version Analyzed**: Technical Specification v3.0 (spec.md)
**Codebase State**: Production-ready MVP with comprehensive IIIF support
**Assessment**: Strong foundation with 80%+ spec coverage. Critical gaps in Content State API, static export quality, and full IIIF compliance edge cases.

**Architecture Strengths**:
- Local-first with IndexedDB + Service Worker is innovative
- QC Dashboard with auto-healing is excellent UX
- Field Mode addresses real-world research constraints

**Architecture Concerns** (from spec feedback):
- Service Worker memory limits for large images (spec suggests hybrid pre-gen + dynamic)
- Convention system conflicts with biiif ecosystem
- Missing scalability details for 1000+ image collections

**Next Steps**:
1. Prioritize Content State API (critical for collaboration)
2. Improve static export (self-contained sites)
3. Add external validator integration
4. Conduct WCAG accessibility audit
