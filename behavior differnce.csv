View,Current,expected
Archive,Clicking on the extract button says added view as annotation but there is no indication that anything worked,The button that is hidden behind thge fullscreen button opens up somehtiong called evidence which has a screenshot of the view but you can’t zoom too deeply into the image or add annotations
Archive,Share button gives a url that doesn’t work,The url should take you to the detailed view of the object

Ingest,The choice to choose manifest or collection seems to have unpredictable consequences,The rules should be documented somewhere based on the iiif spec
Structure and file tree,"too long of a scroll since it shows canvas, annotation, annotation page,manifest and collections",needs a better way to navigate
Structure,"Has nonsensical buttons like Build TOC, synthesis workbench(this opens a whole different detail view than from the arvhive), reveal in archive, view in workbench","Consolidate, conform, collate"
app,There are screens that you cannot back out of unless you refresh,better signposting
Structure,No idea what the structural modelling behavior policies do,better consequences and explanations
