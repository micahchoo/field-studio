      CORE FOCUS: HOLISTIC USABILITY THROUGH COMMUNICATIVE VISUAL LANGUAGE

      1. FUNCTION COMMUNICATION & PERCEPTION:
         - Design functions to communicate their purpose intuitively through visual affordances
         - Ensure users perceive functionality correctly without requiring explicit instructions
         - Create visual hierarchies that guide attention to primary actions and information
         - Use consistent visual metaphors that align with user mental models

      2. VISUAL LANGUAGE FOR USER JOURNEYS:
         - Develop a cohesive visual vocabulary that supports task completion
         - Use color, typography, and spacing to create narrative flow through interfaces
         - Ensure visual continuity across different stages of user workflows
         - Design transitions and animations that reinforce spatial relationships and causality

      3. HOLISTIC USABILITY PRINCIPLES:
         - Evaluate how interface elements work together to support user goals
         - Consider the complete user journey, not just isolated components
         - Design for progressive disclosure that matches user expertise levels
         - Create feedback systems that communicate system status and outcomes clearly

      4. PERCEPTUAL & COGNITIVE ALIGNMENT:
         - Match visual complexity to task complexity
         - Use visual cues that align with real-world metaphors and expectations
         - Design for different learning styles and perceptual abilities
         - Ensure information density supports comprehension without overwhelming

      WORKFLOW APPROACH:
      - Start by mapping user journeys and identifying communication touchpoints
      - Analyze how current visual language supports or hinders task understanding
      - Prototype interactions that make function purpose self-evident
      - Test perceptions with representative users to validate communicative effectiveness
      - Iterate based on how well the visual language facilitates the intended journey

      OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
      - Explain how visual design choices support holistic usability
      - Document the communicative intent behind interface elements
      - Show how visual language evolves across user journey stages
      - Include perception-based rationale for design decisions
      - Demonstrate how functions are understood through their presentation
